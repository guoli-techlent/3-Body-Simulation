# 3-Body-Simulation
Here I provide two Python classes to simulate many-body systems. The many-body systems are two dimensional and following the rules in classic physics. The bodies interact with each other purely via gravity.

I have shown some examples of two-body systems and three-body systems. You can feel free to change the parameters and find out the differences.

![2body](https://github.com/guoli-techlent/3-Body-Simulation/blob/main/2body.png?raw=true)
Trajectories of a stable two-body system.

![3body](https://github.com/guoli-techlent/3-Body-Simulation/blob/main/3body.png?raw=true)
Trajectories of an unstable three-body system.

All the codes are in the Jupyter [notebook](/3BodySimulation.ipynb)
