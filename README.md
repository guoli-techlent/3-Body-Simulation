# 3-Body-Simulation
Here I provide two Python classes to simulate many-body systems. I have shown some examples of two-body systems and three-body systems. You can feel free to change the parameters and find out the differences.

The many-body systems are two dimensional and following the rules in classic physics. The bodies interact with each other purely via gravity.

All the codes are in the Jupyter [notebook] (/3BodySimulation.ipynb)
